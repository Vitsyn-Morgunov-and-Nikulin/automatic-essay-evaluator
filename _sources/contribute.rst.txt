How to contribute
=================

In our development process we followed practices described by Uncle Bob in his magnificent "Clean Code". Please, consult this book in case any trouble.

Make a fork of this repository, and develop your own tool. Make sure it is error-free and the test coverage is at least 60 percent. Update :code:`config` files accordingly, and check their operability.

While producing your code, use this famous `git workflow <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_. Also note that our branches use prefixes :code:`feature/`, :code:`fix/`, and :code:`ci-cd/`.

Further, send a pull request. In the comment, write the main features of the tool, the technology stack used, and a brief description of the algorithms. This should be enough for us to accept your code.

To check the quality of the code, we use :code:`flake8` and :code:`codacy`.
